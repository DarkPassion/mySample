## SRS Overview

SRS is industrial-strength live streaming cluster, for the best conceptual integrity and the simplest implementation. SRS provides variety of inputs, for example, [[Push RTMP to SRS | v1_EN_SampleRTMP ]], [[Push RTSP/UDP/FLV to SRS | v2_EN_Streamer]], [[Pull Stream to SRS | v1_EN_Ingest]]. SRS can transform the RTMP to other protocols or deliveries, for example, [[RTMP Transcode | v1_EN_SampleFFMPEG]], [[Snapshot| v3_EN_Snapshot]], [[Forward to Other Servers | v3_EN_SampleForward]], [[Remux to HTTP-FLV | v2_EN_SampleHttpFlv]], [[Remux to HLS | v1_EN_SampleHLS]], [[Remux to HDS | v2_EN_DeliveryHDS]], [[DVR to FLV | v3_EN_DVR]]. SRS canbe used in CDN for large stream clusters, for example, [[RTMP Cluster | v3_EN_SampleRTMPCluster]], [[VHOST | v1_EN_RtmpUrlVhost]], [[Reload | v1_EN_Reload]], [[HTTP-FLV Cluster | v3_EN_SampleHttpFlvCluster]]„ÄÅ[[Kafka | v3_EN_Kafka]]. Futhermore, SRS provides apis, for example, [[HTTP Callback | v3_EN_HTTPCallback]], [[Security | v2_EN_Security]], [[HTTP API | v3_EN_HTTPApi]], [[RTMP Bandwidth Test | v1_EN_BandwidthTestTool]].

## Downloading

Get SRS from the [downloads page][website] of the project website. If you'd like to build SRS from scratch, visit [[Build SRS | v3_EN_Build]].

SRS runs on Linuxs, for instace, Centos and Ubuntu, and x86, x86-64, ARM and MIPS is ok. MacOS only supports code edit and build. SRS does not support other Unix-like system, neither windows. SRS build on the coroutine library [state-threads][st], which simplify the complex protocol imlementations.

SRS is easy to run on a machine, or multiple machines, to run the cluster. SRS is single process, not multiple processes model; you can use [go-sharp][sharp] for HTTP-FLV multiple processes, and [srs-dolphin][dolphin] for RTMP.
